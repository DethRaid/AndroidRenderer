# Attempts to add the infrastructure necessary for automatically adding C/C++
# tests using the Catch2 library, including either an interface or pre-compiled
# 'catch' target library.
#
# It first attempts to find the header on the local machine, and failing that,
# clones the single header variant for use. It does make the determination
# between pre-C++11 and will use Catch1.X rather than Catch2 (when cloned),
# automatically or forced.. Adds a subdirectory of tests/ if it exists from the
# macro's calling location.
#
# ~~~
# COMPILED_CATCH - If this option is specified, then generates the 'catch' target as a library with
#       catch already pre-compiled as part of the library. Otherwise acts just an interface library for
#       the header location.
# CATCH1 - Force the use of Catch1.X, rather than auto-detecting the C++ version in use.
# CLONE - Force cloning of Catch, rather than attempting to use a locally-found variant.
#
# !WARNING! - When switching between COMPILED_CATCH and non-COMPILED_CATCH, the binary folders will need
# to be cleared for it to take proper effect.
# !WARNING! - The parameters of the first processed instance of the macro will determine the catch target
# configuration. There's no mixing of configs here.
